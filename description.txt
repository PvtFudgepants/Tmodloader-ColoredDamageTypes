Colored damage types changes the tooltip and damage text of weapons to be colored, so that it's easier to quickly tell what kind of damage the weapon deals at a glance.

Melee: Red
Ranged: Green
Magic: Blue
Thrown: Brown
Summon: Pink
Sentries: Purple

Now has cross-mod support! For instructions on how to add your mod's damage type, check out the github:

v1.7.2
-Fixed issue where some custom projectiles were causing errors.

v1.7.1
-Fixed error where tooltips weren't showing up in newest tmodloader version.
-Added Mod.Call support to allow for other mods to add their own colors/support to this mod. 

v1.7.0
-Updated to work with tModLoader 1.4 alpha. Let me know if there are any bugs, especially with the multiplayer as I didn't get to fully test that part.
-The cross-mod support probably will NOT work even after the mods update. I'll need to see how they handle new damage types with the tModLoader changes.
