v1.7.0
-Updated to work with tModLoader 1.4 alpha. Let me know if there are any bugs, especially with the multiplayer as I didn't get to fully test that part.
-The cross-mod support probably will NOT work even after the mods update. I'll need to see how they handle new damage types with the tModLoader changes.

-Added cross-mod support for Calamity, Redemption, Enigma, DBZ, Battle Rods, and Clicker Class damage types.
-Added toggle to disable damage numbers.
-Added toggle to disable other players damage numbers in multiplayer.

v1.5.0
-Now works in multiplayer! Test it out and let me know if you run into any problems.
-Remade the config menu again. Tried to make it a little easier to get through.

v1.4.0
-Finally got around to adding mod configuration through tmodloader.
Old mod config files won't work, so unfortunately you'll need to redo your configs if you had changed anything.

v1.3.0
-Added support for in game config reloading through Hamstar's Helpers mod.
-Split Sentries and Summons into 2 separate damage types w/different colors. Sentry damage is colored Purple.

-Now also changes the color of the text that shows when you deal damage to match the damage type of the weapon! 
Note: Some projectile based weapons may show incorrect damage types. This needs to be manually changed for each individual projectile type. Please report any weapons that use incorrect colors.
Thorium damage types are not yet supported with this, and will use different colors for Symphonic and Radiant damage until the mod is updated
-This mod will now create a config file when loaded for the first time. You can use this file to toggle tooltip or damage colorings, and set individual colors for each type! Supports rgb and hex colors!
